/_HINTS_/

1. You can use an array method to iterate over the data and create HTML string for each menu item.

2. You can use a data-attribute to link a button to a menu item.

3. When an item is added to an order, you will need to push its object to an array of orders and iterate over that array to generate html string.

4. To remove an order, you will need to figure out the index of that menu item’s object in the array of orders.

5.⚠️ The strict equality operator (===) will return false unless you are comparing the same data types. For example: console.log(1 === ‘1’) // false The first 1 is a number, the second ‘1’ (with inverted commas) is a string. You can check a data type using typeof and then google how to change, say, a string to a number or vice versa if necessary!
